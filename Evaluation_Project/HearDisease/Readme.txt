Problem Statement:

Data Set Information:

This database contains 14 attributes. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer-valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1,2,3,4) from absence (value 0).

 

Only 14 attributes used:
1. #3 (age)
2. #4 (sex)
3. #9 (cp)
4. #10 (trestbps)
5. #12 (chol)
6. #16 (fbs)
7. #19 (restecg)
8. #32 (thalach)
9. #38 (exang)
10. #40 (oldpeak)
11. #41 (slope)
12. #44 (ca)
13. #51 (thal)
14. #58 (num) (the predicted attribute)
